			<h2 id="about"> About Us </h2>
				<p class="text"> This all started when I was 16 years old and I developed really sensitive skin. Every brand that I tried would be too chemically and would burn my skin. So then I decided to do my own research of natural ingredients for sensitive skin. I decided to test a whole bunch of different food items on my face and none of them burned!</p>
				<p class="text"> Then I ended up experimenting with different combinations of honey, aloe, shea butter etc. and made my first lotion. My friends had sensitive too so they tried it. One day my friend suggested that I should sell it and get some money, I thought that was a great idea.</p>
				<p class="text"> That night I went home and made ten bottles and made an Etsy account. I decided to price them at $10 a pop. The next day they all sold out! Thatâ€™s when I knew I had something here. I started getting my cousins to help make the product and manage the Etsy site and we made more and more batches and they all kept selling out! Then we decided to branch off into lip and made our own natural lip balm then soap and shower gel. </p>
				<p class="text"> Now 4 years later we have our own factories and website. I really love animals so our products are all natural cruelty free vegan and gluten free. I care for the environment so all of our packaging is recyclable.  This is my journey and I hope you will come along with me. </p>
