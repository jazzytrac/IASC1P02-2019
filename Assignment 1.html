				<title> What is Lorem Ipsum? </title>
			</head>
		<body>
		<p>
			<strong> Lorem Ipsum </strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
		</p>
			<h3> <em> Why do we use it?</em> </h3>
		<p>
			It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <em>'Content here, content here'</em>, making it look like readable English.
		</p>
			<h3> <em> Where can I get some? </em> </h3>
		<ol>
			<li> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,</li>
			<li> but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour</li>
			<li> or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. </li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,</li>
			<li> you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</li>
